This report is written for the reason that there are so many Research Chemicals out there and that so many people (myself included) who are willing to do them and have no idea what is in them. This is a cautionary tale, one that I hope will make people think twice before snorting, shooting, smoking, plugging or ingesting a chemical they know nothing about.<br/>
   <br/>
I have tried just about every type of drug I could get my hands on since the age of thirteen. The list goes on and on, but my preferred drug of choice has always been stimulants. Cocaine and methamphetamine were my two all time favorites. In 2011 I had lost my last connection to illicit drugs and an NBC Dateline special alerted me to drugs that were being sold in head shops and online, ‘bath salts’. Ignoring all of the bad things they had to say I concentrated on the good: euphoric, cheap, legal. I immediately got online and found a site where I purchased $40 worth of bath salts, which turned out to be five 500 MG packages of White Rush. After it arrived in the mail I researched it for months before I ever tried the stuff. If what I found was true, I had MDPV. Eventually I worked up the courage to try it, but to my credit it actually took eight months! All the things I’d read about it made me very leery, and I valued my brain too much to be so reckless. <br/>
<br/>
Well, the time and the place finally arrived, and it got me very high but it was somewhat scary. After using one full package over the course of several months I threw it away, deciding that it was too dangerous. Trip reports I’d read told of people binging on it for days and succumbing to psychosis. I did not want this to happen to me.<br/>
    <br/>
About a month after tossing it I was jonesing again so I returned to the internet to see what I could find. My research turned up VIP Champagne shoe deodorizer. After much debate I bought a gram, and when it arrived I waited about two months before I tried this one. I couldn’t find (in all my investigations) what the active chemical in it was, so I decided at some point that it was probably MDPPP. Sounded right. I wound up doing the gram in four separate sessions, finding that snorting this stuff did nothing but smoking and IV usage were very pleasant. It was like cocaine and similar to the White Rush but I could use it over the course of eight hours or so and not worry about any heart related issues, as had been the problem with MDPV. When the package was gone and I wanted to order another, the manufacturer had stopped making it.<br/>
    <br/>
Several months went by and I ordered and tried many different things, none of them with any good results. ‘Arctic Rush’ was one (did nothing) ‘Lifted’ was another (less than nothing) and then I branched out into kratom and salvia. <!--Those experiences are best saved for another report.--> In January of 2013 I saw that VIP Champagne was going to be available again, in a new formula, two actually. One was in a gold package, the other in a red package. I ordered one of each to the tune of about $40 per.<br/>
    <br/>
Once again the same thing: it arrived and I left it alone for a while until I finally had the proper amount of time (and courage) to try it. As with the other version I couldn’t find what was in it, but the biggest difference was that this one came with a warning: Do Not Use This Product With Alcohol Or Any Other Substance. I think that was a big reason I didn’t touch it for so long; I like drinking beer with everything I do. <div class="pullquote-right1"><div class="pullquote-text">I like drinking beer with everything I do.</div></div><br/>
    <br/>
One Saturday after work (and only a couple of small things to do the next day) I was drinking beer and smoking weed and, after consuming a pizza and passing out in front of the TV, I awoke and suddenly decided I was going to try the VIP Champagne in the gold package. It was a powder with little chunks, so I eyeballed and laid out what I thought was about 20mg’s and snorted it. <br/>
<span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Two samples of powder (even of the same chemical) with equivalent volumes won't necessarily weigh the same. For this reason, eyeballing is an inaccurate and potentially dangerous method of measuring, particularly for substances that are active in very small amounts.
See <a href="/psychoactives/basics/basics_measuring1.shtml">this article on The Importance of Measured Doses</a>.]</span> Thirty minutes later I felt my heartbeat rev up, coupled with a slight sense of euphoria, but not enough to make it worthwhile. Mostly I just felt jacked up. Fearing for my safety, I popped 2mg’s of Xanax I had on hand just in case. <br/>
<br/>
About thirty minutes after that I felt my hear rate slowing, and now that I felt like I was ‘safe’ I decided to try smoking some. Here is where the trip report truly begins, but where my clarity of what was going on ends. I placed a small pile on tinfoil (the same amount I snorted) and found it burned right up. The buzz was intense, highly euphoric…awesome! It lasted maybe a half hour or so before I felt like I needed more, but that is approximate; I totally lost control with this stuff, much like I always did with cocaine and meth. I soon lost focus on how much and when I was doing it, although I shifted from smoking to shooting. Shooting this stuff was really good, the buzz very powerful, and I was having a blast. I actually have no idea what I was ‘doing’ while doing this drug; I honestly can’t remember. I blasted away for about eight hours before deciding to pop another 2mg Xanax and stop for the night. I slept for three hours and woke up knowing where I was, what I was doing etc., and after completing the two tasks I had to do (in an aprazolam haze; I drove and I barely remember doing it) <span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href="/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif">Don't do it!</a>]</span> I returned to my place and decided to start shooting and smoking the VIP Champagne again. I used it all day, for probably twelve hours, and all I can say is that I spent that time attempting to write emails and texts and doing stuff on my computer but all of my physical abilities were wiped out. Seriously, I couldn’t even write a two-word sentence without it taking an hour, but that was okay with me, I felt so good. I remember making phone calls to anyone in my Rolodex, anyone who would pick up their phone. I sounded fine and clear but my memory of all of this is vague and my motor skills were shot. By eleven that night I decided to stop because I had work the next day, and using only Benadryl I got about six hours of sleep.<br/>
    <br/>
My personal hell started after that. Because of a crazy, erratic heartbeat I wound up ducking out of work and went to an urgent care by about ten-thirty that morning. I told them the truth, showed them the IV marks, begged for something that would make me feel better. The doctor gave me 20mg Propranolol, a drug used for high blood pressure. This brought my heart rate down but it also made me dizzy. I made it through the day but my problems were far from over. When I tried to sleep that night I found that every time I was right on the cusp, just about to fall asleep, one of my limbs jerked, instantly awakening me. It went on like that all night.<br/>
    <br/>
Any stimulant abuser has probably been through this before; I had experienced this once or twice before from a combination of cocaine and heroin. It generally lasted one night and then went away. Not this time. It went on for five days before I was finally back at the urgent care, begging the doctor for a sleep aid. She prescribed 50mg trazadone first and, when that didn’t work and I went back to her, she prescribed 2mg lorazapam. That did work, but the efficacy was diminished by the third night, and this sleep twitch was far from gone. <br/>
<br/>
Here is where the story can get long and drawn out but I’ll boil it all down into its major components: I went to see my doctor and he misdiagnosed me, telling me the drug had opened up within me latent bi-polar disorder. He wanted to put me on Seroquel. I went and got a second opinion and that douche bag was worse than the first. He told me to seek psychiatric care. I went to a psychiatrist and she listened, deemed me to be a drug addict and gave me a limited prescription for Ambien under the condition that I see her again for reassessment. I then told my doctor this and he prescribed 1) 30mg Mirtazapine and then 2) medical marijuana then 3) 5mg ropinerol (this drug is for Parkinson’s and on low doses restless leg syndrome). None of them worked, and some (the ropinerol) had very nasty side-effects. Finally, at my ropes end and ready to commit suicide, I confessed all of this to my parents and they flew me home to see a doctor of theirs who then referred me to a neurologist. The neurologist set me up to do a sleep study, at which time I was diagnosed with ‘exaggerated hypnic twitches’ and prescribed .5mg clonazapam. He had heard of this disorder; it is mostly seen in meth and cocaine addicts. That drug finally worked. <br/>
<br/>
To this day (fourteen months later) I still suffer about once a week from these sleep twitches. The neurologist hypothesized that they would go away eventually, and he was right, but they are never completely gone, and as of yet I haven’t done any stimulants. I am able to drink alcohol and smoke weed occasionally but sometimes I get the twitches from that. Other times stress causes them, or going to bed too late and being very tired.<br/>
    <br/>
This is very lengthy and without dosage and/or an actual trip report, but what I can say is that the high was like cocaine and heroin combined: stimulated and alert but with no motor skills. It was a good buzz but it certainly wasn’t worth the $10,000 it cost me in doctors, treatments, loss of work, embarrassment at being such a druggy etc. etc. etc.<br/>
    <br/>
Before trying some drug you buy off of the internet I urge you to do some research first. If you can’t find what is in it, don’t do it. And if it says not to combine it with alcohol or other drugs…DON’T! As bad as I felt throughout the sleep problem at least I didn’t overdose, at least I didn’t die. I walked away, albeit much poorer. Be smart, be safe, always know what you are putting in your body. You never know where it might take you. Peace.<!-- End Body -->
